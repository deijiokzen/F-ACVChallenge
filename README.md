In this challenge focused on signal processing, I embarked on a comprehensive investigation into a diverse range of modulation schemes, including 4QAM, 8QAM, 16QAM, 32QAM, and 64QAM. Each of these modulation schemes presents unique challenges and complexities that require a thorough analysis. To address these intricacies, I employed a sophisticated ensemble of deep learning models, namely ResNet, MobileNet, and InceptionV3, to gain a deep understanding of the intricacies inherent in each of these modulation schemes.

The objective of my project was to delve into the distinctive characteristics and performance aspects of these modulation schemes, which play a crucial role in modern communication systems. By leveraging the power of deep learning techniques, I aimed to extract profound insights that could contribute to advancements in wireless communication technologies, ultimately leading to improved data rates, enhanced spectral efficiency, and refined demodulation strategies.

During the analysis of the extensive signal dataset encompassing 4QAM, 8QAM, 16QAM, 32QAM, and 64QAM, I harnessed the capabilities of ResNet, a prominent deep residual network architecture. The depth and skip connections within ResNet enabled me to effectively capture and analyze the intricate relationships and fine-grained features present in the high-order modulation signals. This facilitated the learning of hierarchical representations of the data, unraveling subtle nuances and providing insights into the performance characteristics associated with each modulation scheme.

To further enrich my project's exploration, I integrated MobileNet, a lightweight yet efficient convolutional neural network. MobileNet's adaptability and computational efficiency proved invaluable in handling the extensive signal dataset, ensuring swift analysis of the distinctive features and intricacies embedded within the modulation schemes. By leveraging depthwise separable convolutions, MobileNet adeptly extracted intricate information, enabling a granular understanding of the unique properties exhibited by each modulation scheme, including 4QAM, 8QAM, 16QAM, 32QAM, and 64QAM.

In addition to ResNet and MobileNet, I incorporated InceptionV3, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, into my project. This allowed me to capture spatial and temporal convolutions, enabling a comprehensive exploration of the multi-scale features present in the 4QAM, 8QAM, 16QAM, 32QAM, and 64QAM signals. The inclusion of InceptionV3 provided insights into the intricate relationships between symbols and noise in these modulation schemes, contributing to advancements in demodulation techniques and signal quality optimization across a broad range of modulation orders.

Overall, through my meticulous analysis utilizing ResNet, MobileNet, and InceptionV3, I have gained a deep understanding of the complexities inherent in modulation schemes such as 4QAM, 8QAM, 16QAM, 32QAM, and 64QAM. The insights obtained from this project have the potential to drive advancements in wireless communication technologies, optimizing data rates, spectral efficiency, and overall system performance for a wide range of modulation orders in practical applications.
